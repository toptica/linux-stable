config MXC_IRQ_PRIOR
	bool "Use IRQ priority"
	depends on ARCH_MXC
	help
	  Select this if you want to use prioritized IRQ handling.
	  This feature prevents higher priority ISR to be interrupted
	  by lower priority IRQ even IRQF_DISABLED flag is not set.
	  This may be useful in embedded applications, where are strong
	  requirements for timing.
	  Say N here, unless you have a specialized requirement.

	depends on ARCH_MXC
	help
	  This option enables the generic SSI layer that makes it possible to
	  write drivers that decide at runtime which SSI port to use.
	  Since the SSI signals must be routed through the AUDMUX, there is no
	  reason to hardwire any driver that utilizes the SSI interface to a specific
	  SSI port.
